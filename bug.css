The CSS specificity rules can lead to unexpected styling behavior.  For example, consider this scenario:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.myClass {
  color: red;
}

#myID {
  color: green;
}

#myID.myClass {
  color: purple; 
}

#myID.myClass div {
  color: yellow;
}
```

A `div` element with both the `myClass` and `myID` classes, and nested inside another `div`, will end up yellow due to the high specificity of the `#myID.myClass div` selector.  This might not be intuitive for developers unfamiliar with the cascading and specificity rules.

Another common issue is the use of `!important`, which overrides all specificity rules and can make CSS hard to maintain and debug. Overuse of `!important` can create conflicts and make it difficult to track down the source of styles.
